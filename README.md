"The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using Unix signals."

Create a communication program - in C - in the form of a client and server. The server is the first one to be launched, having to display its PID after.
The client will take as parameters the server PID and the string to be sent. Once the string has been received by the server,
this one should display it.
